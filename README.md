Scrumy Client
=============

Scrumy Client is a Ruby REST client wrapper for [Scrumy](http://apidoc.scrumy.com).
This is primarily an experiment in metaprogramming with Ruby and the foundation
for creating a DSL that can generate Ruby REST client wrappers for any REST API.

As of this writing there is very little caching done internally and it is not
recommended for use in a production environment.
